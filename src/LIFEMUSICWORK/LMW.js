            For the 20+ Youngsters, I conceptualised 'Propelling Stories', where
            we help individuals to revamp their personal / digital presence
            through websites and social media strategies. We harness the
            impeccable power of story-telling and illustrations to capture the
            ever declining attention spans and evoke powerful emotions.
